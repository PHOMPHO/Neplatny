<p>With her name meaning "void" in slovenian, Neplatný was a gift from the friend who created her, they are not on neopets anymore, but I still cherish her like the day I got her. From the beginning my plan was to make her a Mutant Acara, their space / alien-like features captivated my heart to create yet another space themed character, following the footsteps of <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=_suco_">suco</a> and <a href="/~espirrador">espirrador</a>, my other RW pets.</p>
<p>With that in mind, however, I wanted her to be from a rival species of alien creatures, slightly inspired by a semi recent view of the movie <b>Alien vs Predator</b> I set out to make her first design, in July 12th, 2016, I finished her first draft on recolor.me, and only on August 24th, 2019 I would make her final design and reference sheet. Most of her design was inspired by the nebula-like parts of the mutant acaras body, while also trying to find a good balance of futuristic / sci-fi clothing to complement her galactic bounty hunter aesthetic.</p>

<p>As time went by and the price of the transmog potion went up, I sort of just put her aside and didn't really look back, until an unexpected FFQ quest popped up on my screen, and at that moment I knew I would be saving at least 6m NP by painting her mutant!</p>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3ljY5Zp.png" style="width: 50px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ssy1p4E.png" style="width: 50px;"></center>
<p>That was also when my excitement for her and her story sparkled again, now I had the opportunity to actually create and write a page and not seem like very wishful thinking while I cried over having to save up 6m NP to paint her while my other pets also awaited to be painted...</p>
<p>Jokes and terrible neopoints spending habits aside, let's talk a bit about what inspired me to create both her design and story! As I've mentioned before, <b>Alien vs Predator</b> was quite a big influence (so much so I was actually going to add a Xenomorph / Yautja image to her moodboard, needless to say it didn't fit), other than that the <b>Cyberpunk RPG</b> manual was also a big inspiration, mostly for coming up with a character outfit that seemed futuristic enough but also a little bit 80s inspired.</p>
<h1>ꂦꅏꋊꈼꌅ</h1>
<p>My name is <a href="/~abyss_citadel">Abyss</a>  and my pronouns are they/them, I'm a non-binary mortuary sciences student living in <i>Brazil</i>. I like writing, playing video games, cooking, collecting avatars, creating characters, photography and fashion. My favorite genre of media is horror, I love watching horror movies and playing horror themed games, and I would say my favorites in order are <i>Army of Darkness</i> and <i>Silent Hill 2</i>. In real life I have three cutesy little cats, Samara (10yo), Dothi (2yo) and Valeska (8mo) and a <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=wglitch">significant other</a> that has been quite a light of hope in my life.</p>
<p>I've been on neopets since around 2009 and my journey with writing and creating characters began right here on this website! My first few characters were very inspired by (almost carbon copies of) <i>Twilight</i>, which, at the time, was very much my favorite book, but as I aged and was lead to explore other types of media I began to like other things, my writing style and my characters evolved alongside me and their stories were driven to be more dark and mature, which I began exploring off site and this prompted me to stay away from neopets for a few years (around 2012-2015), to not only explore my passion with more violent and real characters but also to hone my writing skils.</p>
<p>During this period I stayed away from the site, many things changed in my life, not only mental health related topics but also other major life changes, I always had this inexplicable feeling of being an alien amidst my peers, and among the other kids in my school at the time I was seen as a weirdo and a creep. This feelings of isolation and anguish were one of the main reasons my characters turned from "weird little goofbals" to "traumatized children fighting against a society that doesn't accommodate for them", the later being a feeling I don't believe I've overcame just yet. With this swirling thoughts inside my head I began to write my most extensive piece during this hiatus, <i>Memories of Creation</i>, a dissertation that helped me deal with a lot of religious trauma, idealization and other horrible life experiences, and included not only a few of the characters I had began to create on neopets but completely new characters that I began to develop because of it.</p>
<p>Alongside the complete change in tone that overcame my writing style I also began to see these characters more like realistic depictions of people instead of this invincible creatures that could only exist in pure fantasy, even if fantasy elements where embedded into the story itself. This change in tone can still be seen in newest characters like <a href="/~roginol">Roginol</a> and <a href="/~CAPITALISATION">Tali</a>, for example, they are both obviously toned down to accommodate for the rules on the site, but pieces of it still stand.</p>
<p>After this period away from the website I returned only to find my old account had been terminated, which did sting me a little bit at the time but also made me realize that those characters would live on in my work no matter what, so why not take this new found opportunity to start over and have a fresh beginning? With this mindset I created <a href="/userlookup.phtml?user=sterneflugel">sterneflugel</a>, the junction of two german words I always though had a nice sound to them, <i>sterne being star</i> and <i>flugel being wing</i>.</p>
<p>Right now, my main goals are to develop my characters more and make dedicated petpages for most of them, collecting avatars and overall improve my account. You can find my portfolio <a href="/~abyss_citadel">here</a> and my character directory <a href="/~_suco_">here</a>, you can talk to me about anything you want to <a href="/neomessages.phtml?type=send&recipient=sterneflugel">here</a>.

<p>Can a lost princess rise again and build a new kingdom from dust? Having to bear the burden of forever searching for the ones that massacred her people, Neplatný haunts the few planets still populated by others in search of information, bounty hunting around the galaxy to feed her thirst for vengeance. Her royal background completely dismissed by her peers who only know of her feats of hunting, survival is the only option in a scenario where no one can hear you scream.</p>
<h1>ꉣꌅꂦꄞꂑ꒒ꈼ</h1>
<b>Name:</b> Neplatný<br><b>Species:</b> Kulgils Kraik'un<br><b>Age:</b> 2500 years old<br><b>Birthday:</b> 12th July<br><b>Gender:</b> Female<br><b>Pronouns:</b> She/Her<br><b>Height:</b> 2,00 cm / 6'6" ft<br><b>Weight:</b> 178 pounds<br><b>Eye Color:</b> Cyan<br><b>Hair Color:</b> Midnight Black<br><b>Markings:</b> none<br><b>Powers:</b><br><i>Great Strength</i> - Able to do feats of strength greater than many others;<br><i>Extreme Dexterity</i> - Able to calculate and excute movements with incredible accuracy under any circmstances;<br><b>Element:</b> Air<br><b>Zodiac:</b> Cancer<br><b>Occupation:</b> Bounty Hunter<br><h3>Personality</h3>
<p>Neplatný is a quiet and mysterious woman who has a thirst for vengeance for the ones that ended her species, not talking much, and only when necessary. Being a dangerous creature that comes from a species that thrives for hunting she generally doesn't care about the safety of others, with the mentality that "only the strong should survive". In the rare times she emotes and is actually happy, her expresion softens and a small smile forms on her lips, under stress she keeps her emotionless face and starts to rationalize everything, for sadness, however, her brows and body drops, and her voice gets slightly high pitched.</p>

<p>Verlax 66 is a far away planet with a very cold atmosphere, with a general temperature of around -15ºC / 5ºF in most seasons, while in winter being able to go down to around -50ºC/-58ºF, not many creatures are able to thrive in such conditions but the Kraik'un where the ones who colonize the planet and beat all the odds of survival. Even after thousand of years of their disappearance, their presence is still noticeable on the planet.</p>
<p>The landscape is filled by mountains and small yurt-like structures made out of black steel, the few creatures who survive in this environment are generally thick skinned or furry, having only one main continent completely covered in ice, with every bit of land connected by the frozen oceans and lakes. A few different colonies were founded, which spawned five different clans: Kulgils, Thaegi, Taqots, Umhons and Zoldal, all clans were friendly to each other but still maintained a level of competitiveness while hunting in other planets.</p>
<p>No resources where ever abundant but the Kraik'un were able to cultivate the lands with strange fruits named "tuts", that look slightly like bananas and where cooked to make a variety of dishes. While they were hunters by nature, they did not only do it for sport, being also a mean of survival, collecting the meat and hide of the creatures around the planet while trying to maintain a natural balance.</p>
