<p>Can a lost princess rise again and build a new kingdom from dust? Having to bear the burden of forever searching for the ones that massacred her people, Neplatný haunts the few planets still populated by others in search of information, bounty hunting around the galaxy to feed her thirst for vengeance. Her royal background completely dismissed by her peers who only know of her feats of hunting, survival is the only option in a scenario where no one can hear you scream.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6mVxUur.gif">
<p>Neplatný is a quiet and mysterious woman who has a thirst for vengeance for the ones that ended her species, not talking much, and only when necessary. Being a dangerous creature that comes from a species that thrives for hunting she generally doesn't care about the safety of others, with the mentality that&nbsp;"only the strong should survive". In the rare times she emotes and is actually happy, her expresion softens and a small smile forms on her lips, under stress she keeps her emotionless face and starts to rationalize everything, for sadness, however, her brows and body drops, and her voice gets slightly high pitched.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/y2Ec1sE.png" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>Yaryl is a far away planet with a very cold atmosphere, with a general temperature of around -176ºC / -284ºF in most seasons, while in winter being able to go down to around -205ºC/-337ºF, not many creatures are able to thrive in such conditions but the Kraik'un where the ones who colonized the planet and beat all the odds of survival. Even after thousand of years of their disappearance, their presence is still noticeable on the now barren planet.</p>
<p>The landscape is filled by mountains and small yurt-like structures made out of black steel. The few creatures who survive in this environment are generally thick skinned or furry. Having only one main continent completely covered in ice, with every bit of land connected by the frozen oceans and lakes. A few different colonies were founded, which spawned five different clans: Kulgils, Thaegi, Taqots, Umhons and Zoldal, all clans were friendly to each other but still maintained a level of competitiveness while hunting in other planets.</p>
<p>No resources where ever abundant but the Kraik'un were able to cultivate the lands with strange fruits named&nbsp;"tuts", that look slightly like bananas and where cooked to make a variety of dishes. While they were hunters by nature, they did not only do it for sport, being also a mean of survival, collecting the meat and hide of the creatures around the planet while trying to maintain a natural balance.</p>

With a low policy rule, most stores and departments are not much more than fronts for the galactic organized crime. With an intricate and vital Life Support System that keeps the air within the station breathable, the temperature sits at a constant average of 22ºC / 71ºF and 25ºC / 77ºF.</p>
<p>The Space Station is composed of multiple levels which is the exact number of is unknown. However, there are a minimum of 57 levels cataloged throughout the years, with a few on board elevators listing the levels as: 1-40, B1-B3, M1-M5, X1-X5, E, N, G and Q. All main access between these levels is typically via the central elevator or manual teleport stations, but there are at least a few maintenance tunnels that exist and connect most levels for easy access.</p>
<p>With a gigantic tech export market, the Space Station is banked by the Virtupets Inc., which means maintenance and expansion has never been a real issue. However, little import happens from other planets to the station, that is thanks to the great amount of recycling that takes place in the center of the Station, which also finances the Space Station University on board.</p>

<b>routine</b>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1O12Qum.gif" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>As a bounty hunter, Neplatný doesn't have a necessarily strict routine with her moving all around the galaxy for her jobs. She still likes to maintain some semblance of it, however. Waking up generally very early (around 4am to 5am in her natural clock), she enjoys having a workout before having breakfast and looking over her communication lines for any jobs. With Neplatný acting on her own as a single unit, she also has a habit of making sure all of her equipment is in working function. So cleaning and maintenance is also part of her daily routine.</p>
<b>hobbies</b>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y0ILzEj.gif" style="float:right;margin:5px;"><p>Even with her life being mostly swamped with her job, Neplatný still enjoys different hobbies when not worried about her next target. With tinkering and taxidermy being her two favorite hobbies. Both things she learned while still young and around her family, with taxidermy being a big part of her late culture as a way to preserve the good memories of the hunt and to honor their fight. After living astray for so long, tinkering became the perfect way to keep any needed life support machines in working condition and a good way to incorporate new pieces of equipment to her living arrangements.</p>

<b>ambitions</b>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X42Upg5.gif" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>Since the war and her species extinction, Neplatný's biggest ambition has been to find the perpetrator of such thing and making them pay for it, as it would have been tradition for her culture. She never had any intentions of being a famous bounty hunter, but with the job and notoriety also comes the gift of information which walks hand in hand with her own agenda. Even if it isn't her main focus, being good at her primary job and succeeding in the hunt is just as important as her main goal of getting revenge.</p>
<b>struggles</b>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7CRPtVv.gif" style="float:right;margin:5px;"><p>Even with her very controlled emotions she still suffers from her families greatest flaw, the rage. Most of her family was known for their feats in war, generally fueled by their rage and bloodthirsty, a very big inherited trait of the Kraik'un clan. But being the only one left of her species also plays a big role in the galaxy not knowing much about her heritage and genetic makeup. In a room full of other species, she isn't one to standout, which makes her efforts in her new career hardly seen.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yxWNqKe.gif" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>Guided by her family and culture, Neplatný believes in the survival of the fittest. If you can't adapt you can't survive, that's the simplest rule. It's the reason why she can't quite agree with what happened to her family, a surprise attack is nothing but cowardice and a full blown show of weakness.</p>
<p>For most of their lives, the Kulgils live in small villages in order to provide for each other. If one is not fit for any roles they must find their own path away from their families and villages, which proves to be more difficult in the icy jungle of Yaryl. They live to survive but hunting and showing their strengths is also a part of that survival.</p>
<p>Strength was always an important word inside her life, the Kraik'un where known for their feats of war and strength, which made Neplatný grow to appreciate her own qualities more than her flaws. Which is the complete opposite of how she views others, in her career as a hunter she tends to notices others flaws before ever considering their qualities.</p>

<b>Volkodlak, the Werhond</b>
<div class="clearfix">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N2dh7bU.png" style="float: right;margin: 5px;"> <p>One of the few things she has kept from her homeland is her loved companion, Volkodlak. These canine-like animals where mostly domesticated by the Kulgils and used for hunting or protecting their villages from outside attacks, almost like guard dogs.</p>
<p>With the pet being around her since childhood and used to traveling it seemed like the perfect fit for her new lifestyle. Volkodlak was well trained for combat even if Neplatný prefers to hunt on her own, but in certain situations he proves to be just as if not more useful as her high-end tech.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/R69h9GK.gif" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>With her name meaning invalid, null or void in Slovenian, she was a gift from a friend who had created her, they are not on neopets anymore, but I still cherish her like when I got her. From the beginning my plan was to make her a Mutant Acara, their space / alien-like features captivated my heart to create yet another space themed character, following the footsteps of Suco and Espirrador, some of my other two RW pets.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/euUc2A8.gif" style="float:right;margin:5px;"><p>With that in mind, however, I wanted her to be from a rival species of alien creatures, slightly inspired by a semi recent view of the movie Alien vs Predator I set out to make her first design, in July 12th, 2016, I finished her first draft on recolor.me, and only on August 24th, 2019 I would make her final design and reference sheet. Most of her design was inspired by the nebula-like parts of the mutant acaras body, while also trying to find a good balance of futuristic / sci-fi clothing to complement her galactic bounty hunter aesthetic.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FXV5DY4.gif" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>As time went by and the price of the transmog potion went up, I sort of just put her aside and didn't really look back, until an unexpected FFQ quest popped up on my screen, and at that moment I knew I would be saving at least 6m NP by painting her mutant!</p></div>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iSHQyKe.gif" style="float:right;margin:5px;"><p>That was also when my excitement for her and her story sparkled again, now I had the opportunity to actually create and write a page and not seem like very wishful thinking while I cried over having to save up 6m NP to paint her while my other pets also awaited to be painted...</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4pQJOod.gif" style="float:left;margin:5px;"><p>Jokes and terrible neopoints spending habits aside, let's talk a bit about what inspired me to create both her design and story! As I've mentioned before, Alien vs Predator was quite a big influence, other than that one of my favorite games Mass Effect also played a big part on her design. I wanted a futuristic look that also seemed a little bit retro inspired so she could fit into Virtupets and their characters (also I love rgb stuff so you know I would give her loads of rgb looking weapons lol).</p>

<div style="height:400px;overflow:auto;padding-right:10px;">
<p>There’s never been a job too horrible, too gruesome, too difficult for me. If the money was enough then I would make sure to finish my part of the deal. I never cared about the implications, the karma, the morals, the politics. Why should I have cared? My hands had already been tainted by the scarlet blood that flowed on the battlefield that almost no living creature knew existed behind their normal daily lives.</p>
<p>Politics isn’t as pretty or as glamorous as it may seem. The bloodshed behind others' backs was what kept our business always alive, what a ridiculous way of putting it. If there’s a company, corporation, or politician out there, they’ve probably needed my work in some way. There’s always someone to kilI, someone who needs to be buried with another’s secret, whatever may be the case, that was my job.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any alliances, I didn’t have any colleagues, I didn’t need any of it. This hell was my heaven, my blood boiled for the adrenaline, it was in my DNA after all. The Kulgils were known for their blood lust, we were born as hunters and lived as hunters. But then again, it’s not like many have heard of us, or just me since the rest of them have been dead for a few centuries now.</p>
<p>We were wiped from space and history. I wasn’t there, I could do anything but I know my people didn’t simply die without a fight. Whenever I saw their battlefield I knew they didn’t, they couldn’t. After that, my life spiraled down into the sin of kilIing for profit. Even so, I never had to courage to beg for mercy or salvation. Nothing more than a nomad followed by a path painted in scarlet red. My misery had no name, or face because I never wanted, needed, to be forgiven by anyone.</p>
<p>That was my path of self-destruction, and if I was going to die I hoped it would be on the battlefield just like the rest of my species. This life was both my heaven and my hell, and I knew it from the beginning, right after my first job.</p>
<p>It was the son of a rival senator, the only thing keeping my contractor from keeping his job. The money was more than enough to survive for a few months, that much for such a simple thing seemed stupid but I’ve grown to learn how much these insignificant things matter to the rich and powerful. To them I was a weapon, to me, they were my survival inside the station.</p>
<p>My first few scores weren’t pretty. They were messy, bloodshed, and painful. Even if I knew what I was doing, they didn’t react like animals, they were much more rational and calculated. They were expecting me. Knives, guns, I learned how to use everything, I had a supplier of course. A retired soldier. Vojak had been in the first space war, he was old and covered by uncountable scars, he knew how young I was from the second I stepped inside his “shop”. Our relationship quickly became more like a mentor and mentee than shop owner and customer.</p>
<p>He knew I had no emotional ties to him, just like I knew he was only doing this because of the guilt of the war. He lost many comrades, many around my age, others even younger. I never asked much and he never talked much about it either. As much as he tried to simply tell me to run away I knew there wasn’t any way out after the first kilI. You don’t spill the first blood in your hands and get away, the more you do the deeper you get. If you run the beast will catch you, but if you stay it will eat you. There’s no win.</p>
<p>“Do you truly wish for such sorrow to follow you forever, kid?” he asked me once, but my result never wavered. I didn’t have anywhere to go back to, even if I wanted to run. I had no one to care for me, and no one to care for. That was the simplest way of putting it. And as much as I hated thinking about it, my family would never be proud of such a thing, so I lied to myself, about how proud they would be to see my skilIs, how proud they would be to see how strong I had become. But I’m sure they wouldn’t.</p>
<p>My feelings only kept on getting more complicated the more I did. I knew my brain was messed up on the inside, I could feel what felt almost like lesions, irreparable. Parts of my psyche were broken, my ego, my honor, my values. I lost control of the most important pieces of myself, so I keep on going. Whenever in a job I could feel the blood rushing through my every vein, the adrenaline that kept me alive, and the urge to keep the bloodshed going took control of both my body and soul. I couldn’t simply hide it. And least I hid it, the more jobs I got, the more the rich wanted, needed, my services.</p>
<p>I knew I had to bear the dirtiest of duties, I was the kilIing machine they so desperately needed to solve their stupidest problems. And I was more than happy to do it for the right price. I didn’t work for any sides, I worked for the highest bidder. Was it treason? Was it wrong? Did I even care to begin with? I had no reason to refuse them, they had no reason to not choose me.</p>
<p>Ugliness and beauty walked side by side in this kind of living. Notoriety meant more than anything else. Soon other hunters knew my codename, they all wanted to know who the “blood hound” was. I don’t think it took long before they began to question if the rumors were true. “How could a woman be the best?” they questioned. Not something I expected, but then again, I came from a race of warriors and fighters. Gender meant nothing to us, if you couldn’t fight you weren’t worth the tribe’s resources, much less survival itself. Survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Many of the vermin tried to fight me just to prove the rumors wrong. It was meaningless bloodshed. Yet I counted it as survival. Fear ran through their eyes. “I told you” were the only words I ever whispered to their dying bodies as I left them behind me. There was no light nor shadow in this world, they were both empty words used to describe those who can fake their purest image the best. And the deeper I went, the more silence conquered me. Talking had never been my strongest of suits, but suddenly no words left my lips. I didn’t need them. I had already lost my sense of being.</p>
<p>However, there was still one thought in my mind. One single fear I simply couldn’t shake off. I didn’t want to simply die in vain. Some nights I would wake up in a cold sweat, and I could feel the numbness on my fingers. But wasn’t that the simple ending for someone like me? Dying in the shadows, not remembered by anyone.</p>
<p>Paranoia. It spreads through your mind, it takes control of your every action. It annoyed me to no end, there was no way to avoid it. So I knew the only way out was to destroy everything. Everything I knew, everything I was. So I simply became nothing more than the Blood Hound itself. No feelings, no regrets.</p>

<h4>ꉓꃄꋫꉣ꓅ꑾꋪ 2 - ꌇꁹ꓅꒐꒒ ꓅ꃄꑾ ꃲ꒐꓅꓅ꑾꋪ ꑾꁹꃸ</h4>
<div style="height:400px;overflow:auto;padding-right:10px;">
<p>The air was always too dense to breathe while on a job. But breathing is the most important skilI for an assassin if you breathe too heavily your body will go into disarray and the enemy will notice you. If you breathe too lightly you won’t have enough energy to fight if necessary. That’s the reason why the fiercest hunters in nature all seem to be quiet and steady. But I wasn’t that well trained back then. I could feel the pressure on the back of my neck, the pain from pressing my teeth together.</p>
<p>My target wasn’t all that difficult compared to the amount of stress I was building up inside my head. Just a dumb politician’s wife. Apparently, she was double-crossing the guy, sleeping with the enemy and selling his secrets or something like that. It honestly didn’t seem that relevant, I was wrong. The tall skyscr.aper seemed almost empty, I was way more comfortable with close-quarters combat than I was with a gun so I childishly decided to enter without any information on the actual location.</p>
<p>It was a full-on penthouse. An enormous place that was full of expensive crap. The second I stepped inside the alarm went off. Security was everywhere. Even if my exosuit could camouflage my body my breathing had gone array and they could tell where I was with no problem. I could feel buried underneath the pressure, the adrenaline.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have to explain what happened. They very much caught up to me, the fight wasn’t pretty for any side, but the job itself wasn’t pretty anyways. With what seemed like all the mirrors inside that godforsaken house pointed at me all I saw was a figure that resembled myself covered in my blood. The exact picture you would expect of a wild animal running amok in a highly populated city.</p>
<p>The woman was locked inside her bedroom. As soon as the lock clicked she believed herself to be safe. “Did you deal with the pest?” her voice said before looking at the frightening picture that stood there. “W-who?!” she tried to scream as the gunfire went off. The white sheets now forever crimson. The splatters everywhere. My job was done.</p>
<p>I was nothing but a ghost, buried beneath a graveyard of bitter grief. Optical camouflage was my way out the same as it had been my way in, but I’m sure someone noticed the bloody footprints left behind. And just as the world had forsaken me, I decided to leave.</p>
<p>Patching myself as best as I could I knew I had been deceived. “Son of a…” the words escaped my lips as the bright light of the hologram on my wristband lit up. The payment had been made, with the simple message “thank you for taking care of the pest”. I had been used, but then again, wasn’t that my only purpose? It’s not like I knew.</p>
<p>Outside in the city, I could feel the coldness of the rain on the few bits of exposed skin. The space station was very much a controlled habitat, why did it rain, then? I felt insane as the water soaked my jacket. I felt sane when the windows around me began to fog. But the pain of my recent injuries were still in the back of my mind. It didn’t matter how much technology I had access to, there was nothing I could do about the pain. It eroded my brain into nothingness.</p>
<p>When I finally got back to myself I was sitting at Vojak’s table. “I need the pills,” I said without any hesitation. He was the only person that had a contact at a pharmaceutical company and could get the kind of painkilIers I needed. He had been around, he knew I wasn’t asking for party pills or something of the sort. “Give it up, hrt” the stupid nickname he gave me blurted out of his throat as it had always done. I hated the sound of it, but he always said it was his mother-tongue word for “hound”.</p>
<p>With the gray hair on his back, his face not turning to face me, I knew he was serious about it. “This job isn’t for you” he continued with a disapproving tone. If we had met in different circ.umstances he would probably be the closest thing to my father since his death. “I have to fight” was my only answer before getting up from the comfortable chair and walking back out into the rain. He didn’t follow me, that was simply the kind of relationship we had. I would have done the same if I was in his shoes.</p>
<p>I knew my heart had been torn into thousands of pieces when I saw the battleground my homeland had become when I found their bodies lying coldly on the floor. I would never be able to mend those cr.acks no matter how much I tried. The kilIing wasn’t going to do it. Neither would loving someone or caring for them.</p>
<p>There was nowhere for me to go as the pain began to spread to my every thought. There was nothing but a sense of vertigo, almost like a bitter blow to my brain. I circled the darkness high and low, anything that could take that damn pain away would be enough. Anything!</p>
<p>But the further you go into the darkest of shadow, no one dares to follow you there. No matter how much I wanted to deny I didn’t have anyone by my side, neither friend nor foe. The rain was still strong, maybe I was insanely hallucinating, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference anyway.</p>
<p>I could feel my memories rotting the more I walked. What even were their names again? Did I even know who I had lost? Everyone? But who was everyone anyways? I was fighting to survive, but survive what? Was I simply lying to myself just as much as I was lying to other people? Yes, I was.</p>
<p>The only reason I fought was to feel alive again. Surviving was nothing more than a direct response.</p>
<p>Once again I found myself staring at Vojak’s ceiling. This time in an old bed. On the side table was a simple flask with the painkilIers I had asked for with a note underneath. “Stop being such a hard child,” he wrote in his messy handwriting. I doubt he had gone after me, and more that I had gone after him.</p>
<p>Our relationship was simple, we didn’t ask anything out of each other that we didn’t need. So once again, if we had met under different circ.umstances he would probably be the closest thing to my father. He acted the same, sometimes even spoke the same. But what was his name again?</p>
